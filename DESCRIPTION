Description: A package to parse Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 bag files to plot the end-effector position in 3-dimensional space. This package relies on using a Universal Robot, as its forward kinematics is done using UR3 values, and joint positions from the /joint_states topic. Additionally the /ur_controller/state topic is included to plot the error of the real robot position and the desired robot postion. This package is intended to be used with a ROS 2 bag file and a CSV file monitoring the topics recorded in the bag file. The CSV file is generated as an intermediary, as R does not provide the necessary deserialization option for DDS messages. The ROS 2 bag file is utilized for the topic information, then targets corresponding CSV files related to the topics to isolate only the relavant information for better analysis.
